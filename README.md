Quasimorph mod for Faction Growth Control

Have you ever felt that faction balancing is off?
Can't explore Jupiter because you're afraid it'll trigger the endgame too early?
Isn't it frustrating when one monster faction steamrolls all the others in seconds?
Want to enjoy a long game without being stuck fighting just one dominant faction?

Try this mod.
It brings balanced, yet dynamic faction power progression—so you can play longer, explore more, and face evolving challenges.

## What this mod do

1. Modifies the default power cost and benefit of missions.
2. Modifies the success rate of missions that end due to time expiration.
3. Adjusts the amount of power gained and lost based on the number of stations each faction owns.
4. Limits the total number of missions to prevent excessive generation.

## Configuration

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at:  
`%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\FactionGrowthControl\config.json`

If you're unsure about what the configuration options mean,  
a detailed explanation will be provided in a future update.

If you can't wait for future update, ask to your chatGPT.
